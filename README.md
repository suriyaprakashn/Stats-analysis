# Statistical Analysis Projects

This repository contains two statistical analysis projects:
1. FIFA World Cup Player Dataset Analysis
2. Mobile Network Dataset Analysis

## üìä Project 1: FIFA World Cup Player Analysis

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains player information from FIFA World Cup, including:
- Height, Weight, Overall Rating, Potential
- Preferred Foot, Skill Moves, and other attributes

### Analysis Performed

#### a) Central Limit Theorem with Age Population
- Performed CLT with sample size of 200
- Calculated standard error and mean of sampling distribution
- Compared with population mean and standard deviation
- Explanation of why standard error decreases with increased sample size

#### b) Hypothesis Test: Overall Rating > 80
- One-sample t-test to check if average overall rating exceeds 80
- Significance level: Œ± = 0.05

#### c) Preferred Foot vs Potential Analysis
- Statistical test (t-test) to examine foot preference impact on potential
- Graphical analysis (box plots, bar charts)

#### d) Relationship: Overall Rating vs Potential
- Correlation analysis between two continuous variables
- Regression analysis to quantify relationship

#### e) Skill Moves Effect on Overall Rating
- Graphical analysis (grouped visualizations)
- Statistical analysis (ANOVA or t-tests)

### Technical Specifications
- Significance level: 5% (Œ± = 0.05)
- Assumed normal distribution and equal variance
- Used appropriate statistical tests for each analysis

## üì∂ Project 2: Mobile Network Analysis

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about:
- Internet usage, calls, and messages across various networks
- Network types and duration metrics

### Analysis Performed

#### a) Confidence Interval for Call Duration
- Calculated 95% and 99% confidence intervals for average call duration
- Compared interval widths and interpreted results

#### b) Network Distribution Analysis
- Statistical test to check if networks are equally distributed
- Chi-square goodness-of-fit test

#### c) Duration Distribution by Network
- Plotted distribution of call duration for each network
- Comparative graphical analysis

#### d) Relationship: Item vs Duration
- Statistical tests to identify relationships
- Detailed explanation of class relationships

#### e) Relationship: Network vs Network Type
- Statistical analysis of categorical variables
- Appropriate tests for association

### Technical Specifications
- Significance level: 5% (Œ± = 0.05)
- Performed tests of normality (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- Performed tests of variance (Levene's test, Bartlett's test)
- Used appropriate statistical tests based on data characteristics
